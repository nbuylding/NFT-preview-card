## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to create a hover overlay effect, how to center one image over another, and how to find solutions to issues that arose throughout this building process.


### Continued development

Concepts I'm not completely comfortable with and need to focus on are media queries and making websites more responsive to other device screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped to remind me how to use certain CSS tools.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me find the answers I needed through other people's experiences.
